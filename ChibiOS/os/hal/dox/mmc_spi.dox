/**
 * @defgroup MMC_SPI MMC over SPI Driver
 * @brief Generic MMC driver.
 * @details This module implements a portable MMC/SD driver that uses a SPI
 *          driver as physical layer. Hot plugging and removal are supported
 *          through kernel events.
 * @pre     In order to use the MMC_SPI driver the @p HAL_USE_MMC_SPI and
 *          @p HAL_USE_SPI options must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section mmc_spi_1 Driver State Machine
 * This driver implements a state machine internally, see the @ref IO_BLOCK
 * module documentation for details.
 *
 * @section mmc_spi_2 Driver Operations
 * This driver allows to read or write single or multiple 512 bytes blocks
 * on a SD Card.
